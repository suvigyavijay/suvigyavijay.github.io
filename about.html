  <p>I'm Suvigya Vijay, a Computer Science Master’s student at the University at Buffalo. As a tech alchemist, I 
    claim to be a jack of all trades and even a master of some, with experience spanning machine learning,
    data engineering, full-stack development, system design, and even basic UI/UX design and 3D animations.</p>
  <p>Rapid learning is my superpower, enabling me to grasp new technologies swiftly and apply them seamlessly on the
    go. While my past work as a Data Scientist at Flipkart involved machine learning, particularly in demand
    forecasting for a million products, my current focus lies in the realm of system design. I am advised by Professor
    Haonan Lu, exploring and designing distributed consensus algorithms.</p>
  <p>I hold a B.E. (Hons) in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and an M.Sc.(Hons) in Economics from BITS
    Pilani. Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, you'll find me playing badminton, embarking on treks, and
    immersing myself in the world of gaming—especially Rocket League.</p>
