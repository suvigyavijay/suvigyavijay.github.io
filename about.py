Hi there, I'm Suvigya. I'm a developer currently living in Bangalore, India. 

Currently, I'm a Data Science Intern at Flipkart in the Planning team.

While I love my work, I'm always curious about tech, anything related to computers, and interested in design. This being said I have tried out multiple domains including graphic designing, web and app development, deployment, and given a shot at numerous software tools.
